Predicting if the driver is distracted or not based on dashboard cam images

One in five car accidents is caused by a distracted driver. This is an alarming statistic, even more so for car insurers. Profits would take a toll every time such a customer made a claim. State Farm is giving dashboard cams a try to check if it would help in these situations. If the footage can show that the driver was distracted at the time of an accident, State Farm could save money in those one in five cases. In this project, we will be detecting if a driver is distracted or not based on the images obtained from dashboard cams using machine learning algorithms.

Algorithm used for 
1. image processing: SURF
2. feature extraction: Bag of visual words (using k-means on image descriptors)
3. image classification: Logistic Regression and SVM
